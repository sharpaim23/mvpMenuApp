# mvpMenuApp
Introduction
a *rough* MVP of a Menu App that is built using the MVC Architecture, we have also implemented "authorization" so users can sign up, customize & personalize the app

Be sure to fork it for your own copy

Objectives
To take this beginner level app and turn it into a geolocation app that can pull restaurant menu's from almost any restaurant within the metropolitan area the user is located.

Also in the works is a favorite button that will allow users to select their favorite restaurant menu's and randomize them when the user doesn't know what they want to eat. 

The randomize button will also work on the regular menu's if the user wanted to try a new place to eat.
